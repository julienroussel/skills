# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this repo is

A collection of personal Claude Code skills (slash commands) — `/audit`, `/review`, `/ship` — plus companion shell CLIs that partner with those skills. Each skill is a `SKILL.md` file in its own directory; companion CLIs live under `bin/`. There is no application code, no build system, no tests — just markdown skill definitions and shell scripts.

## Repo structure

```

ship/SKILL.md                      — ship working-tree changes via PR (split analysis, branching, CI, merge)
shared/reviewer-boundaries.md      — canonical dimension-ownership table, severity rubric, confidence levels

### `shared/` — single source of truth

Files in `shared/` are referenced by `/audit` and `/review` at Phase 1 Track A. Each SKILL.md reads them in parallel with the other config files and enforces a **hard-fail guard**: if any shared file is missing, empty, or fails to Read, Phase 1 aborts immediately. Rationale: the inline duplicates at former call-sites were removed to eliminate drift; a missing shared file means the skill's guarantees (reviewer boundaries, untrusted-input safety, cache-write .gitignore checks) cannot be enforced, and silently degrading coverage is worse than aborting.

Usage pattern per file:
- `reviewer-boundaries.md` — passed verbatim into every reviewer subagent prompt.
- `untrusted-input-defense.md` — passed verbatim into every reviewer, implementer, simplification, convergence, and fresh-eyes subagent prompt.
- `gitignore-enforcement.md` — the lead agent applies the protocol at each `.claude/*` write site (cache files, audit reports, suppressions). Call-sites keep the `git ls-files --error-unmatch <path>` command and a per-site "Why" reason inline for reliability; the prose expansion of warn/append behavior lives in the shared file only.

**Exception — secret-warnings.json**: `/review` Phase 5.6 writes `.claude/secret-warnings.json` under a site-specific atomic-write protocol (`flock` + `.tmp` + `mv`, per-session filename variants). That inline block is NOT a gitignore-enforcement duplicate — it's a different protocol that happens to start with a similar security check — so it stays fully inline.

## Skill file anatomy

Each `SKILL.md` has:
1. **YAML frontmatter** — `name`, `description`, `argument-hint`, `effort`, `model`, `disable-model-invocation: true`, `user-invocable: true`. Note: there is no per-skill `advisor-model` field — the advisor tool uses the global `advisorModel` setting in `settings.json`.
2. **HTML comment block** — declares plugin dependencies, required CLI tools, cache files read/written, and required Claude Code tools
3. **Body** — phased execution plan with argument parsing, flag conflict resolution, display protocol, and detailed per-phase instructions

## Shared conventions across all three skills

- **Phased execution**: Every skill runs in numbered phases. Each phase has a prominent `━━━` header and a running cumulative timeline (`Phase 1 ✓ (3s) → Phase 2 ✓ (18s) → ...`).
- **Parallel-first**: Tracks within a phase run simultaneously via multiple tool calls in a single message. Independent Bash/Read/Grep calls are always batched.
- **Silent agents, noisy lead**: Reviewer/implementer subagents report via TaskCreate and SendMessage only — no console output. Only the lead agent prints progress.
- **Shared cache files** in `.claude/`: `review-profile.json` (stack/package-manager detection), `review-baseline.json` (validation command baselines), `review-config.md` (suppressions and auto-learned rules), `audit-history.json` (append-only audit log).
- **Model routing**: Reviewer and implementer agents spawn with `model: "opus"`. Mechanical phases (context gathering, dedup, validation, cleanup) use the default model.
- **Severity rubric** (canonical: `shared/reviewer-boundaries.md`): critical → high → medium → low, with confidence levels certain → likely → speculative. Low-severity findings are dropped unless trivially fixable.
- **Reviewer dimension boundaries** (canonical: `shared/reviewer-boundaries.md`): Strict ownership of finding categories to prevent duplicates (e.g., silent failures → error-handling-reviewer, not security or typescript).
- **Finding format**: Every reviewer finding must include `file`, `line`, AND a `codeExcerpt` (3 consecutive lines from the cited file, verbatim). Phase 3 step 0 sanity-check reads the cited range and rejects any finding whose excerpt doesn't match — catches line-number AND content hallucinations. Per-reviewer 25% rejection rate escalates to Phase 7 `ACTION REQUIRED`.
- **Fix verification (Phase 5.55)**: After implementers mark findings "addressed", the lead re-reads the cited `file:line` (±5 lines) and confirms the issue described in the finding is no longer present. Classifies each as verified / unverified / moved. Soft flag — informs user, does not auto-revert.
- **`nofix` mode**: Every skill that implements fixes supports a findings-only mode that skips implementation and validation phases.
- **Memory integration**: `/audit` and `/review` Phase 1 Track A read (a) project memory at `~/.claude/projects/"${PWD//[.\/]/-}"/memory/` (all types — applies to this project), and (b) user-global memory at `~/.claude/projects/-Users-jroussel--claude-skills/memory/` (**`user_*.md` only** — role/expertise/preferences that apply across projects; framework-specific `feedback_*` stays per-repo). Phase 4.5 cross-run rejection promotion writes a `feedback`-type memory to the user-global dir when the same `dimension+category` has been rejected in **2+ separate runs** (with explicit user consent and security dimension excluded). Cross-run state lives in `.claude/audit-history.json` under a shared schema (`runs[]` per rejection, `runSummaries[]` per run, `reviewerStats[]` for FP-rate persistence, `lastPromptedAt` map to suppress re-prompts) — both `/audit` and `/review` read and write the same file.
- **FP-rate calibration**: Each reviewer dimension's running rejection rate (last 5 entries from `reviewerStats[]`) is computed at Phase 1 Track A. If ≥ 25%, a calibration note is prepended verbatim to that reviewer's Phase 2 prompt, instructing it to be more conservative on borderline cases.
- **Graph integration (optional)**: When `codebase-memory-mcp` is available and the repo is indexed, reviewers prefer `search_graph` / `trace_path` / `detect_changes` over Grep for structural questions (call-chain impact, dead-code detection, import edges). Grep fallback preserved when the graph is unavailable. `/audit` probes in Phase 0 Track 3; `/review` probes in Phase 1 Pre-checks (only for diffs ≥ 20 files and non-headless sessions). `/ship` Phase 2 uses `detect_changes` + `trace_path` for split analysis when available.
- **Advisor calls**: `/ship` calls `advisor()` before `gh pr merge` (single-PR step 14 and multi-PR step 11-multi 2a) and before committing to a split plan (step 5). `/review --converge` calls `advisor()` before convergence iteration 3+. `/audit` calls `advisor()` at Phase 4 pre-approval when finding count ≥ 20 OR a single dimension contributes ≥ 60% of findings (skewed-reviewer signal), and at Phase 5 pre-dispatch (always, when implementer-dispatch findings are queued). `/audit --converge` adds a pre-iteration advisor check at iteration ≥ 2. All are irreversible/high-blast-radius junctures; the advisor provides a second opinion without seeing the outcome.

## Worktree architecture: `bin/tackle` ↔ `/ship`

Worktree layout, marker conventions, scratch-session contract, per-session context injection, cleanup paths, and anti-patterns are documented in `docs/worktree-architecture.md`. **When working on tackle or `/ship`, load that doc with `@docs/worktree-architecture.md` to bring the full contract into context.** It is not auto-loaded here so non-tackle work doesn't pay the ~2K-token cost on every session.

Quick reminder of what lives there: role split between `tackle` and `/ship` (no IPC, only filesystem conventions); why tackle does not use `claude -w`; the `scratch-session` and `tackle-type` markers under `.git/info/`; `CLAUDE.local.md` injection registered via `.git/info/exclude`; primary-vs-secondary worktree cleanup paths in `/ship`; and the explicit anti-patterns (do not use `claude -w`, do not commit markers, do not inject context into `CLAUDE.md`, etc.).

## Plugin dependencies

Required: `agent-teams@claude-code-workflows` (team-reviewer, team-implementer, TeamCreate/TeamDelete).

Optional: `pr-review-toolkit@claude-plugins-official` (silent-failure-hunter, type-design-analyzer, code-simplifier), `security-scanning@claude-code-workflows` (STRIDE methodology).

## Key design decisions

- `/audit` and `/review` share the same cache files and stack detection logic (Track C). Changes to one skill's caching format must be mirrored in the other.
- Both `/audit` and `/review` support `--converge[=N]`: a re-review loop that wraps Phases 2–6 in a repeatable cycle with auto-approval. `/review` defaults to 3 iterations (max 10) and runs a fresh-eyes security pass after convergence. `/audit` defaults to 2 iterations (max 5) — lower because the per-iteration blast radius is higher.
- `/review` supports `--branch[=<base>]` for reviewing the full feature-branch diff (committed-on-branch + working tree) as one scope — closes the gap between bare `/review` (working tree only, misses committed work) and `--pr=N` (remote read-only, misses unpushed/uncommitted work). Default `<base>` resolves via `gh pr list --head` (linked PR) or falls back to `origin/<default-branch>` via `gh repo view`. Aborts if local HEAD is behind upstream — local files must reflect HEAD for codeExcerpt verification to be safe. Mutually exclusive with `--pr`. Implementer + validation run normally (fixes apply locally); Phase 8 creates standalone issues, NOT a PR comment.
- `/ship` handles both single-PR and multi-PR (stacked/independent) flows. Split analysis uses semantic grouping heuristics with dependency detection between groups.
- Auto-learned suppressions (Phase 4.5 in audit/review) require 2+ rejections of the same pattern before adding a rule — single rejections are treated as situational. Cross-run promotion to user-global memory needs 2+ rejections in 2+ separate runs (lowered from the original 3+ which empirically never fired).
- Shared protocol files (`shared/*.md`) are validated at Phase 1 with a hard-fail guard PLUS a structural smoke-parse (each file must contain a known load-bearing substring) — catches truncation that the non-empty check misses.
- `/audit` Phase 1 Track B uses lazy-load by default (reviewers fetch files on demand). Use `--prefetch` to restore the original pre-read behavior for ≤ 50-file scopes.
- `/review --pr` mode runs the `codeExcerpt` content match against the PR's post-image fetched via `gh api`, NOT the local checkout — so the hallucination guard works even when the local branch differs from the PR base. `/review --branch` mode reads from the local working tree (the Phase 1 behind-upstream abort guarantees local files reflect HEAD; bare `/review` and `--branch` share the same local-Read path).
