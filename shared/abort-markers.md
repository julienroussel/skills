# Abort Marker Rendering

**Canonical source** for the `abortReason` → rendered-marker mapping. Applied when rendering a Phase 7 cleanup report (the full `abortReason` mapping) and when emitting the Phase 1 hard-fail `[ABORT — SHARED FILE MISSING]` marker. Consumers aren't enumerated here (to avoid per-file drift) — the authoritative source is each skill's own Phase 1 read list, summarised in the repo `CLAUDE.md` "shared/ — single source of truth" section.

## When to render

A skill renders an abort marker in its Phase 7 report only when `abortMode=true`. Each abort site that sets `abortMode=true` MUST also set `abortReason` to one of the values below. Implementations render via Bash `case "$abortReason" in ... ;; esac` (no glob — every value is matched explicitly).

## Reason → Marker mapping

| `abortReason` value(s) | Rendered marker |
|------------------------|-----------------|
| `head-moved-phase-5.6`, `head-moved-convergence-start`, `head-moved-convergence-5.6`, `head-moved-fresh-eyes-pre-spawn`, `head-moved-fresh-eyes-findings` | `[ABORT — HEAD MOVED]` |
| `symlink-escape` | `[REVERT BLOCKED — SYMLINK ESCAPES REPO]` |
| `symlink-readlink-failed` | `[REVERT BLOCKED — READLINK FAILED]` |
| `symlink-readlink-empty` | `[REVERT BLOCKED — READLINK RETURNED EMPTY]` |
| `symlink-dangling` | `[REVERT BLOCKED — SYMLINK DANGLING OR UNRESOLVABLE]` |
| `nul-sort-newline` | `[REVERT BLOCKED — NUL-SORT UNAVAILABLE + NEWLINE IN PATH]` |
| `find-traversal-failed` | `[REVERT BLOCKED — FIND TRAVERSAL FAILED]` — `establish-base-anchor.sh` step 1's `find -type l -print0` exited non-zero (typically permission-denied on a subdirectory). A partial symlink baseline would weaken the symlink-escape gate and misclassify missing symlinks as newly-created on revert. |
| `repo-root-unset` | `[REVERT BLOCKED — REPO_ROOT UNSET]` |
| `anchor-error` | `[ABORT — ANCHOR ERROR]` — script invocation returned an unexpected exit code OR the stderr-marker parse fell through. Caller surfaces the script's stderr in the Phase 7 report. |
| `fresh-eyes-terminal-failure` | `[FRESH-EYES TERMINAL FAILURE]` |
| `secret-halt-*` (all secret-halt variants: `secret-halt-phase-1`, `secret-halt-phase-5.6`, `secret-halt-phase-5.6-user-abort`, `secret-halt-phase-6-regression`, `secret-halt-convergence`, `secret-halt-convergence-5.6`, `secret-halt-convergence-5.6-user-abort`, `secret-halt-fresh-eyes`, `secret-halt-fresh-eyes-user-abort`) | Use the `[SECRET DETECTED — ...]` markers rendered by the secret-halt protocol (`[SECRET DETECTED — CHANGES REVERTED]` post-implementation, `[SECRET DETECTED — NO REVERT NEEDED]` pre-implementation). Do NOT render an additional `[ABORT — *]` marker — avoid duplicate emission for the same event. |
| `user-abort`, `user-abort-convergence`, `user-abort-phase-5-dispatch` | `[ABORT — USER ABORT]` |
| `unmatched-scope` | `[ABORT — UNMATCHED SCOPE]` — `/jr-skill-audit` Phase 1 Track B discovered zero skills. The causes are broader than a filter miss: nothing matched the user's filter (bare positional, `--scope=<glob>` or `--scope-only=<level>`); a bare positional resolves only in a scope `--scope-only` dropped, or is gitignored in its only resolving scope; an unfiltered run had every candidate excluded as gitignored; or, under `--plugin`, no marketplace declares `<name>`, the sole resolution was skipped (non-git marketplace clone, object-form `git-subdir`/url `source`, a marketplace value the sanitizer rejected), or the plugin's tracked skills contain no match. Caller appends an "Available skills: ..." (or "Available plugins: ...") hint where one applies. |
| `shared-file-missing` | `[ABORT — SHARED FILE MISSING]` — a guarded protocol read failed (a required shared or skill-local protocol file was missing, empty, or failed structural smoke-parse): Phase 1 Track A, or a deferred / on-demand guarded read at a later phase. Rendered by any consumer whose guard uses the canonical-marker form; which failures a given consumer renders as this marker vs. as an inline-prose abort is owned per consumer at its own read site, not enumerated here (canonical split: `phase1-track-a-protocol.md` "Abort rendering"). |
| `realpath-unavailable` | `[ABORT — REALPATH UNAVAILABLE]` — a path-containment check that **requires** `realpath` could not run because the binary is unavailable. Emitted by `/jr-skill-audit` at Phase 1 Track B's personal/project availability probe, at Phase 3 step 1a (reviewer-supplied `file` containment), and at `--plugin` skills-dir resolution. Deliberately distinct from `unmatched-scope`: the audit set is fine, the tool is missing, and degrading to a literal comparison would open a path it cannot verify. |
| `*` (anything else, including unset) | `[ABORT — UNLABELED]` — **contract violation**: `abortMode=true` was set without a recognised `abortReason`. Surface it as an escalation in the consumer's Phase 7 report so the gap is visible (the escalation-section label is owned per-consumer, not fixed here — see each skill's Phase 7 body). |

## Markers rendered outside the `abortReason` mapping

Some markers are rendered by their owning protocol independently of `abortReason`. These continue to fire in addition to the table above:

- `[SECRET DETECTED — CHANGES REVERTED]` — CI/headless secret-halt protocol, post-implementation case.
- `[SECRET DETECTED — NO REVERT NEEDED]` — CI/headless secret-halt protocol, pre-implementation case (no `$baseCommit` yet).
- `[REVERT — Untracked files removed]` — CI/headless secret-halt protocol, files cleaned during revert.
- `[AUDIT TRAIL REJECTED — PATH VALIDATION]` — Phase 5.6 schema-validation block / User-continue path behavior 2; emitted when a writer's `file` value fails shared path validation.
- `[SECRET-WARNINGS BACKUP FAILED]` — Phase 5.6 / Phase 7 step 3(a); emitted when the corrupt-file backup `mv`/`cp` itself fails (disk full, permission error, filename collision).
- `[AUDIT-HISTORY BACKUP FAILED]` — `shared/audit-history-schema.md` quarantine protocol (Read-side integrity check); emitted when the corrupt-file backup `mv` itself fails (disk full, permission error, filename collision). Direct analogue of `[SECRET-WARNINGS BACKUP FAILED]`. Halts the run with non-zero exit.
- `[REPORT REDACTION FAILED]` — `/jr-audit` Phase 7 "Post-write redaction verification"; emitted when the post-write scan of the saved report still matches a catalogued secret pattern and the value cannot be redacted without destroying the finding. The report is NOT emitted as a deliverable. Halts the run with non-zero exit. Distinct from the `[SECRET DETECTED — *]` markers, which concern secrets in the **reviewed codebase**; this one concerns a secret the audit itself wrote into **its own output**.
- `[ABORT — GREP -E INCOMPATIBLE]` — `shared/secret-patterns.md`'s POSIX ERE smoke probe, plus every secret pre-scan site that routes a grep exit status above 1 through that file's "Scan-status check" (`/jr-audit`, `/jr-review`, `/jr-ship`, and the pre-commit hook template `/jr-review` installs). Deliberately has **no** `abortReason` value: the runtime `case` matches every value explicitly, so minting one would render `[ABORT — UNLABELED]` in any consumer that had not yet enumerated it.

## Exit-code contribution

All markers in this file contribute to the non-zero Phase 7 exit code per each skill's exit-code rules. Specifically: any `[ABORT — *]`, any `[REVERT BLOCKED — *]`, any `[SECRET DETECTED — *]`, `[FRESH-EYES TERMINAL FAILURE]`, `[AUDIT TRAIL REJECTED — PATH VALIDATION]`, `[SECRET-WARNINGS BACKUP FAILED]`, and `[AUDIT-HISTORY BACKUP FAILED]` force the run to exit non-zero. The unlabeled fallback `[ABORT — UNLABELED]` ALSO forces non-zero (the contract violation is itself a failure signal).

## Anti-patterns

- **Don't emit two markers for the same event.** A `secret-halt-*` reason that has already produced a `[SECRET DETECTED — ...]` marker MUST NOT additionally emit `[ABORT — *]`. The mapping table is explicit about this.
- **Don't render markers when `abortMode=false`.** Phase 7 exit-code rules trigger non-zero exit for several non-abort conditions (`convergenceFailed=true`, `userContinueWithSecret=true`, schema-validation backup), but those have their own surface text and are NOT rendered through this table.
- **Don't add a glob arm in the `case` statement.** Every reason value must be matched explicitly so a typo (e.g., `serect-halt-phase-1`) falls through to `*) → [ABORT — UNLABELED]` and surfaces the contract violation. A `secret-halt-*) ...` glob arm would silently absorb typos.
